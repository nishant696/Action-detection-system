## Introduction
The Action Detection System is designed to identify and classify different actions in video footage. This system utilizes deep learning techniques to detect actions with high accuracy. It is implemented primarily in Jupyter Notebook and Python.

## Features
- Action detection using deep learning models.
- High accuracy and performance.
- Easy to use with a simple interface.
- Includes sample data for testing and demonstration purposes.

## Installation
To install and run the Action Detection System, follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository:
    ```sh
    git clone https://github.com/nishant696/Action-detection-system.git
    cd Action-detection-system
    ```

2. Install the required dependencies:
    ```sh
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```

## Usage
To use the action detection system, run the following commands:

1. Train the model (if necessary):
    ```sh
    python train.py
    ```

2. Test the model with sample data:
    ```sh
    python test.py
    ```

3. Run the application:
    ```sh
    python app.py
    ```

## Examples
Sample usage and results can be found in the [Demo Images](./Demo%20Images) directory. The provided Jupyter Notebook `Action Detection Refine_updated.ipynb` includes step-by-step instructions and examples.
